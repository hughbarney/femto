BUGS encountered during fLisp refactoring and batch mode

- valgrind detects several memory leaks, call with:
  FEMTO_DEBUG=0 valgrind --leak-check=full --track-origins=yes femto

- defmacro segfaults on simple macro expansion, can be reproduced in
  original tiny-lisp.

  (defmacro IF (pred then else)
  (list 'cond (cons pred then) (cons 't else)))

  (IF t "then" "else") -> segfault

- The status line has a ' ' space before the buffer name, but none after.

- On startup with (startup-message) and a small terminal window, the *scratch*
  buffer seems frozen.  Now after introducing batch mode things get worse:
  The status line is on top and only a terminal resize refreshes the display.
